Hi! :wave:

I'm Shane and I'm host of the Linux Lads podcast. I'm a curious person interested in far too many things.

I'm currently in the process of completing redesigning my website from the ground up and posting more content to my blog in future. If you'd like to stay in the loop please subscribe to my RSS feed linked above.
